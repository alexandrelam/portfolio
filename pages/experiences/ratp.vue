    descriptionParagraph="Okarito is a Parisian start-up that aims to improve business travel. It offers an application that allows users to make reservations for flights, trains, hotels and rental cars. I worked at Okarito as a frontend developer and was brought to collaborate with the product manager and the different developers of the company. I participated in the development of more than 65 features and bug fixes and added more than 7350 lines of code to the code base. I followed good developer practices, wrote tests with Jest and Cypress. Thanks to this experience, I learned a lot about the software engineering world and improved my skills in Vuejs and Nuxtjs."
